# Contributor Guide
Thank you for viewing this guide before making contributions to LibreHardwareMonitor!

The majority of this project is composed of C# code. As this is the case, the fall back convention guide
can be found here (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

while the language of the core components of the project are unlikely to change, this project is modular, and new components could
be added at any time. as this is the case please reference this guide before every PR or other contribution, as those changes to the code-base language set will be reflected in this guide.
